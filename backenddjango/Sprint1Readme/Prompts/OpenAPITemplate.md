Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs how to feed this to Q Chat as **modular, scoped prompts** so it works reliably and doesn‚Äôt explode trying to fix 50 things at once.

## üß© Step-by-Step Q Chat Prompts (Modular Sequence)

---

### üîß **Step 1: Fix Backend Warnings in Serializers and Views**

**Prompt 1.1 ‚Äì Fix missing serializer_class in APIViews**
Please scan the following Django modules for any APIView-based views that are missing a `serializer_class` definition:

- backenddjango/applications/views.py
- backenddjango/borrowers/views.py
- backenddjango/documents/views.py
- backenddjango/brokers/views.py
- backenddjango/products/views.py
- backenddjango/reminders/views.py

- backenddjango/users/views.py
- backenddjango/reports/views.py

For each view that lacks a `serializer_class`, please do the following:
1. Suggest an appropriate serializer class based on the view logic or imports (e.g., `UserLoginSerializer`, `DocumentSerializer`, etc.)
2. If the view has dynamic or conditional logic, suggest using a `get_serializer_class()` method instead
3. If no clear serializer is used but the request/response body is simple, use `@extend_schema` from `drf_spectacular.utils` to document the schema manually
4. Output the corrected class code snippet so I can directly apply it in my project

Make sure your suggestions align with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation best practices and drf-spectacular compatibility.

---

**Prompt 1.2 ‚Äì Add @extend_schema_field to serializer methods**
```bash
Please scan all serializers for methods like `get_documents`, `get_status`, `get_notes`, etc., that are causing OpenAPI warnings like ‚Äúunable to resolve type hint.‚Äù

For each method:
- Add a `@extend_schema_field()` decorator (e.g., OpenApiTypes.STR or OpenApiTypes.OBJECT)
- Suggest the appropriate OpenAPI type
- If possible, output a refactored code snippet I can paste directly

Start with the `borrowers` and `documents` modules.
```

---

### üßº **Step 2: Resolve Schema Generation Issues**

**Prompt 2.1 ‚Äì Fix path parameter annotations**
```bash
Please update all router/view path parameters in ViewSets or URL patterns to include proper type annotations like `<int:id>`.

Also, for ViewSets where schema generation fails due to untyped path variables, apply `@extend_schema(parameters=[...])` as needed.

Focus on modules: `borrowers`, `documents`, `reports`, `users`.
```

---

**Prompt 2.2 ‚Äì Fix get_queryset issues for Swagger fallback**
```bash
Please find views where `get_queryset()` fails during schema generation (e.g., throws ‚ÄúField 'id' expected a number‚Äù errors in Swagger).

Wrap the `get_queryset()` logic with this safety check:
```python
if getattr(self, "swagger_fake_view", False):
    return Model.objects.none()
```

Apply this to: `NotificationListView`, `NotificationViewSet`, any report views causing issues.
```

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Step 3: Regenerate Clean Schema**

**Prompt 3.1 ‚Äì Regenerate the OpenAPI schema**
```bash
Now that the backend issues are fixed, please regenerate both `schema.yaml` and `schema.json` using `drf-spectacular`.

Output paths:
- `backenddjango/docs/schema.yaml`
- `backenddjango/docs/schema.json`

Also let me know how many warnings remain.
```

---

### üìö **Step 4: Improve API Documentation Clarity**

**Prompt 4.1 ‚Äì Add code examples for key endpoints**
```bash
Add example request/response snippets in both Python (requests) and JavaScript (axios) for these endpoints:
- /api/users/login/
- /api/applications/ [POST]
- /api/borrowers/ [GET + filters]
- /api/documents/upload/ [POST]
Embed these in the OpenAPI doc using `@extend_schema(examples=[...])` syntax.
```

---

**Prompt 4.2 ‚Äì Add WebSocket authentication + reconnection doc**
```bash
Please update the OpenAPI documentation or README to include:
- How JWT authentication works for WebSockets
- Recommended reconnection strategies with fallback
- Sample connection URL and headers
```

---

**Prompt 4.3 ‚Äì Add Troubleshooting + Pagination Notes**
```bash
Please add documentation sections for:
- Common error response formats (400, 403, 500) with examples
- Pagination and filtering behavior across list endpoints (borrowers, brokers, documents)
- Default `limit`, `offset`, and `ordering` parameters and examples
```

### ‚úÖ Want me to generate you a `Makefile` or `generate_docs.sh` so you can run all this in one command later too?
